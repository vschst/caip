# caip
Check another IP

# Description
The resource checks the strings for the presence of foreign IP address and port.
A search algorithm based on shuffling sequential character combinations of numerals from the check line.
Available settings associated with the IP address mask and range of ports.
Resource exports server function *checkAnotherIP* to check table of string for matching ip:port.

# Installation
Create a new directory with name **caip** in resource directory of your MTA server.
Download the repository files to this folder
```
git clone https://github.com/vschst/caip path/to/directory/caip

# Exported functions
* **checkAnotherIP**
  
  Checks a table of strings for the presence of foreign combination of the form ip:port.
  Comparison of the found combinations are made with the data of IP address and port specified in the settings of the resource.

  * **Type**:
    Server-only function

  * **Syntax**:
    >table **checkAnotherIP**(table **Strings**)

  * **Required Arguments**:
    * **Strings**: Table of string to check.

  * **Returns**:
    Returns a table that contains the keys `ErrorCode` and `Checked`.
    In case of successful execution, `ErrorCode` must be equal to *0*.
    The result of strings check is written to the key `Checked`.
    If `Checked` is equal to *true*, then the table of strings contains foreign combination of the form ip:port, *false* otherwise.

# Example
```lua
-- Checks the nickname of the player and his message when he writes to chat
addEventHandler("onPlayerChat", getRootElement(),
    function(message)
        local playerName = getPlayerName(source)
        
        if (playerName) then
            local checkAnotherIPStatus = exports["caip"]:checkAnotherIP({playerName, message, playerName .. " " .. message})
				
            if ((checkAnotherIPStatus ~= nil) and (checkAnotherIPStatus.Checked == true)) then
              -- Another IP is found
            end
        end
    end
